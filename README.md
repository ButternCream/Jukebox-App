# Jukebox Android Application

Our goal is to develop an app which will act in a similar way to a music jukebox. 
One phone will be hosting itself as a jukebox while other people can connect to the one phone and supply their own music to it through the app. 
The main goal is to have an offline functionality, not requiring wifi, to connect you with your friends and peers to share and stream music through multiple devices at a time.
